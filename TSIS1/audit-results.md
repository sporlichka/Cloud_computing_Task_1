**TO:** Board of Directors, Kcell Company
**FROM:** External Product Transformation Auditor
**DATE:** 26.01.2026
**SUBJECT:** Diagnostic of Product Operating Model Maturity

**1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
Based on the FY2024 Consolidated Financial Statements, Kcell exhibits the characteristics of a **"Digital Immigrant"**. While there is clear strategic intent to pivot towards a "Digital Ecosystem" (evidenced by the SuperApp, OGO Finance, and Scoring initiatives), the company's underlying operating model remains rooted in a traditional Telco "Asset-Builder" mindset. You are managing software the same way you manage 5G towers: as static, capitalized assets. This "IT Service Mode" approach creates a high risk that your digital investments will fail to adapt to market needs after their initial launch.

**2. EVIDENCE OF "FEATURE FACTORY" BEHAVIOR (RISKS)**
*   **Quote 1: "As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of intangible assets included in development costs was 4.113 billion tenge."** (Note 5)
    *   **Risk:** This accounting treatment confirms a **Project Mindset**. You are "building" software, capitalizing the cost, and then likely disbanding the team or moving them to "maintenance." In a Product Operating Model, software is never "done." Treating product development as a "Capital Project" discourages continuous iteration and responsive problem-solving.
*   **Quote 2: "Software and licenses... Amortization period 3-8 years."**
    *   **Risk:** Believing a digital product (like a SuperApp) has a useful life of 8 years without massive reinvestment is a fallacy. Modern tech companies see software as a living service. This long amortization schedule creates a "set it and forget it" culture, leading to massive technical debt and an inability to pivot when user behavior changes.
*   **Quote 3: "Obligation to activate 3,527 5G base stations."** & **"investments in capital expenditures"**
    *   **Risk:** The culture of "Activation" and "Deployment" (Output) dominates the financial narrative. When this culture pervades the Digital/Software division, teams prioritize **shipping features** (Outputs) to meet the "Project Plan" rather than solving customer problems (Outcomes) like engagement or retention.

**3. STRATEGIC DISCONNECTS**
*   **The "Innovation" vs. "Marketing" Gap:** Your Value Added Services (VAS) revenue **doubled** (9.78bn tenge), validating the digital strategy. However, **Marketing and Advertising expenses were cut by ~50%** (4.19bn to 2.02bn). You are building products but starving the growth engine required to scale them. This suggests a "Build it and they will come" fallacy typical of Engineering-led organizations.
*   **The "Asset" Trap:** You have invested massively in the 5G License (~70bn tenge) and Digital Products, crushing your Net Profit (down ~69%). If these Digital Products are managed as "Projects" (delivered on time/budget) rather than "Products" (delivering business results), you will own expensive code that generates no return.

**4. THE PRESCRIPTION**
*   **Shift from Project to Product Funding:** Stop funding "Initiatives" with start/end dates. Instead, fund **Persistent Product Teams** (e.g., "The SuperApp Core Team") with an annual budget to solve specific customer problems.
*   **Redefine Success Metrics:** Move beyond "Development Cost" and "Revenue" to **Product Outcomes**. The Board should review **Retention, Daily Active Users (DAU), and Time-to-Value**, not just financial lag indicators.
*   **Decouple Software from CAPEX Logic:** While IAS 38 requires capitalization, internal management must view software spend as **R&D/Innovation**, not Asset Construction. Empower product leaders to scrap features that don't work without fearing "impairment of assets."
