# Phase 2: From Symptoms to Root Causes (JTBD & Persona)

## Step 1: The Core Internal Problem
**Problem Statement:** "The 'Capitalization Trap' — Product teams are incentivized and funded to 'activate' digital features as static Capital Assets (Outputs), but lack the persistent funding, data access, or mandate to iterate on them for Customer Retention (Outcomes)."

**Why this blocks impact:**
*   Teams wash their hands of a feature once it is "Live" (Capitalized).
*   Improving an existing feature is classified as OPEX (Operating Expense), which is tightly controlled/cut, whereas New Features are CAPEX (Investment), which is abundant.
*   This leads to a bloated SuperApp full of "V1" features that never improve.

## Step 2: The Synthetic User Persona (JTBD Actor)

**Name:** Arman
**Role:** Senior Product Manager, Kcell SuperApp (Lifestyle & Fintech Stream)
**Seniority:** Mid-Senior (3 years at Kcell, previously at a traditional bank)

**Responsibilities:**
*   Delivering the "2025 Strategic Roadmap" (launching 3 new modules: Travel, Insurance, Cinema).
*   Managing the vendor development team (outsourced/internal mix).
*   Reporting progress to the "Digital Transformation Steering Committee."

**KPIs (How he gets his bonus):**
1.  **Roadmap Execution:** % of committed features launched on time.
2.  **Budget Utilization:** Consuming the 4.1bn tenge CAPEX envelope (if he doesn't spend it, he loses it).
3.  **Service Availability:** Uptime of the deployed modules.

**Frustrations & Fears:**
*   **Frustration:** "Management asks why DAU (Daily Active Users) is low on the 'OGO Bonus' feature we launched last year. I tell them: 'Because the onboarding is clunky.' They say: 'Fix it.' I say: 'I can't, my team is 100% booked on the *New* Insurance module for the Q1 release. Fixing old code is maintenance, and I have no budget for maintenance.'"
*   **Fear:** Missing the launch date for the new module. That is the only thing the Board sees in the quarterly report ("Asset Activated").
*   **Incentives:** He focuses strictly on the *definition of done* agreed in the Project Charter. He avoids looking at user analytics because he can't act on them anyway.

**Tone/Language:**
Defensive, focused on "Scope," "Resources," "Approval," "Steering Committee," and "Capitalization Rules." He uses words like "Handover," "UAT Signing," and "Project Closure."

## Step 3: The JTBD Interview Strategy (The "5 Whys")

*Since you will interview the agent yourself, use this script as a strategic guide to dig to the root cause.*

**Target "Why" Questions (Ask these sequentially):**

1.  **Symptom:** "Arman, why are we prioritizing the new 'Travel Insurance' module when the 'Step Counter' we launched last quarter is losing 50% of users per week?"
2.  **First Layer:** "Why can't we pause the Travel module for two sprints to fix the Step Counter onboarding bugs?"
3.  **Second Layer:** "Why is the budget rigidly locked to the 'Travel Module' scope defined 12 months ago?"
4.  **Third Layer:** "Why does the Finance department classify 'fixing onboarding' as a cost (OPEX) while 'building a new module' is an investment (CAPEX)?"
5.  **Root Cause:** "Why does the organization value the *creation* of digital assets more than the *performance* of those assets?"
