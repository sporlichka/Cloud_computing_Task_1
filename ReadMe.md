**TO:** Board of Directors, Kcell Company
**FROM:** External Product Transformation Auditor
**DATE:** 26.01.2026
**SUBJECT:** Diagnostic of Product Operating Model Maturity

**1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
Based on the FY2024 Consolidated Financial Statements, Kcell exhibits the characteristics of a **"Digital Immigrant"**. While there is clear strategic intent to pivot towards a "Digital Ecosystem" (evidenced by the SuperApp, OGO Finance, and Scoring initiatives), the company's underlying operating model remains rooted in a traditional Telco "Asset-Builder" mindset. You are managing software the same way you manage 5G towers: as static, capitalized assets. This "IT Service Mode" approach creates a high risk that your digital investments will fail to adapt to market needs after their initial launch.

**2. EVIDENCE OF "FEATURE FACTORY" BEHAVIOR (RISKS)**
*   **Quote 1: "As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of intangible assets included in development costs was 4.113 billion tenge."** (Note 5)
    *   **Risk:** This accounting treatment confirms a **Project Mindset**. You are "building" software, capitalizing the cost, and then likely disbanding the team or moving them to "maintenance." In a Product Operating Model, software is never "done." Treating product development as a "Capital Project" discourages continuous iteration and responsive problem-solving.
*   **Quote 2: "Software and licenses... Amortization period 3-8 years."**
    *   **Risk:** Believing a digital product (like a SuperApp) has a useful life of 8 years without massive reinvestment is a fallacy. Modern tech companies see software as a living service. This long amortization schedule creates a "set it and forget it" culture, leading to massive technical debt and an inability to pivot when user behavior changes.
*   **Quote 3: "Obligation to activate 3,527 5G base stations."** & **"investments in capital expenditures"**
    *   **Risk:** The culture of "Activation" and "Deployment" (Output) dominates the financial narrative. When this culture pervades the Digital/Software division, teams prioritize **shipping features** (Outputs) to meet the "Project Plan" rather than solving customer problems (Outcomes) like engagement or retention.

**3. STRATEGIC DISCONNECTS**
*   **The "Innovation" vs. "Marketing" Gap:** Your Value Added Services (VAS) revenue **doubled** (9.78bn tenge), validating the digital strategy. However, **Marketing and Advertising expenses were cut by ~50%** (4.19bn to 2.02bn). You are building products but starving the growth engine required to scale them. This suggests a "Build it and they will come" fallacy typical of Engineering-led organizations.
*   **The "Asset" Trap:** You have invested massively in the 5G License (~70bn tenge) and Digital Products, crushing your Net Profit (down ~69%). If these Digital Products are managed as "Projects" (delivered on time/budget) rather than "Products" (delivering business results), you will own expensive code that generates no return.

**4. THE PRESCRIPTION**
*   **Shift from Project to Product Funding:** Stop funding "Initiatives" with start/end dates. Instead, fund **Persistent Product Teams** (e.g., "The SuperApp Core Team") with an annual budget to solve specific customer problems.
*   **Redefine Success Metrics:** Move beyond "Development Cost" and "Revenue" to **Product Outcomes**. The Board should review **Retention, Daily Active Users (DAU), and Time-to-Value**, not just financial lag indicators.
*   **Decouple Software from CAPEX Logic:** While IAS 38 requires capitalization, internal management must view software spend as **R&D/Innovation**, not Asset Construction. Empower product leaders to scrap features that don't work without fearing "impairment of assets."

# Phase 2: From Symptoms to Root Causes (JTBD & Persona)

## Step 1: The Core Internal Problem
**Problem Statement:** "The 'Capitalization Trap' — Product teams are incentivized and funded to 'activate' digital features as static Capital Assets (Outputs), but lack the persistent funding, data access, or mandate to iterate on them for Customer Retention (Outcomes)."

**Why this blocks impact:**
*   Teams wash their hands of a feature once it is "Live" (Capitalized).
*   Improving an existing feature is classified as OPEX (Operating Expense), which is tightly controlled/cut, whereas New Features are CAPEX (Investment), which is abundant.
*   This leads to a bloated SuperApp full of "V1" features that never improve.

---

## Step 2: The Synthetic User Persona (JTBD Actor)

**Name:** Arman
**Role:** Senior Product Manager, Kcell SuperApp (Lifestyle & Fintech Stream)
**Seniority:** Mid-Senior (3 years at Kcell, previously at a traditional bank)

**Responsibilities:**
*   Delivering the "2025 Strategic Roadmap" (launching 3 new modules: Travel, Insurance, Cinema).
*   Managing the vendor development team (outsourced/internal mix).
*   Reporting progress to the "Digital Transformation Steering Committee."

**KPIs (How he gets his bonus):**
1.  **Roadmap Execution:** % of committed features launched on time.
2.  **Budget Utilization:** Consuming the 4.1bn tenge CAPEX envelope (if he doesn't spend it, he loses it).
3.  **Service Availability:** Uptime of the deployed modules.

**Frustrations & Fears:**
*   **Frustration:** "Management asks why DAU (Daily Active Users) is low on the 'OGO Bonus' feature we launched last year. I tell them: 'Because the onboarding is clunky.' They say: 'Fix it.' I say: 'I can't, my team is 100% booked on the *New* Insurance module for the Q1 release. Fixing old code is maintenance, and I have no budget for maintenance.'"
*   **Fear:** Missing the launch date for the new module. That is the only thing the Board sees in the quarterly report ("Asset Activated").
*   **Incentives:** He focuses strictly on the *definition of done* agreed in the Project Charter. He avoids looking at user analytics because he can't act on them anyway.

**Tone/Language:**
Defensive, focused on "Scope," "Resources," "Approval," "Steering Committee," and "Capitalization Rules." He uses words like "Handover," "UAT Signing," and "Project Closure."

## Step 3: The JTBD Interview Strategy (The "5 Whys")

*Since you will interview the agent yourself, use this script as a strategic guide to dig to the root cause.*

**Target "Why" Questions (Ask these sequentially):**

1.  **Symptom:** "Arman, why are we prioritizing the new 'Travel Insurance' module when the 'Step Counter' we launched last quarter is losing 50% of users per week?"
2.  **First Layer:** "Why can't we pause the Travel module for two sprints to fix the Step Counter onboarding bugs?"
3.  **Second Layer:** "Why is the budget rigidly locked to the 'Travel Module' scope defined 12 months ago?"
4.  **Third Layer:** "Why does the Finance department classify 'fixing onboarding' as a cost (OPEX) while 'building a new module' is an investment (CAPEX)?"
5.  **Root Cause:** "Why does the organization value the *creation* of digital assets more than the *performance* of those assets?"

---

# Phase 2: From Symptoms to Root Causes

## Interview Transcript (5 Whys)

**Interviewer (Auditor):** Arman, why are we prioritizing the new 'Travel Insurance' module when the 'Step Counter' we launched last quarter is losing 50% of users per week?

**Arman (Synthetic Persona):** The 'Travel Insurance' module is a key strategic initiative, fully approved and funded as part of our CAPEX roadmap for Q3. My primary focus is to ensure its on-time delivery, as per the Steering Committee's directives and budget allocation. Regarding the 'Step Counter,' we are aware of the churn data. However, any significant re-development or optimization would require a new budget allocation and a separate project initiative, which isn't currently approved for this quarter.

**Interviewer (Auditor):** Why can't we pause the Travel module for two sprints to fix the Step Counter onboarding bugs?

**Arman (Synthetic Persona):** Pausing development on the 'Travel Insurance' module, even for two sprints, isn't something we can do easily. That module has a committed CAPEX budget and a strict Q3 delivery timeline approved by the Steering Committee. Diverting our dedicated resources for two sprints would create significant delays, potentially jeopardize our funding, and would require a formal Change Request and re-approval process, which is quite extensive.

**Interviewer (Auditor):** Why is the budget rigidly locked to the 'Travel Module' scope defined 12 months ago?

**Arman (Synthetic Persona):** The budget for the 'Travel Insurance' module was approved last year based on a detailed business case and a defined scope, linking directly to our annual CAPEX plan. This upfront allocation ensures we have the necessary funding secured for specific strategic projects. Any deviation from that approved scope or timeline requires a new approval process and often impacts the overall CAPEX portfolio.

**Interviewer (Auditor):** Why does the Finance department classify 'fixing onboarding' as a cost (OPEX) while 'building a new module' is an investment (CAPEX)?

**Arman (Synthetic Persona):** Our financial guidelines categorize 'building new modules' as CAPEX because they represent new asset creation or significant functional expansions that drive future growth and are considered investments. Conversely, 'fixing onboarding' or similar improvements to existing features are generally classified as OPEX. These are seen as maintenance costs to ensure the current product operates effectively, rather than creating new value streams.

**Interviewer (Auditor):** Why does the organization value the creation of digital assets more than the performance of those assets?

**Arman (Synthetic Persona):** The organization's structure often links success to the delivery of approved strategic initiatives and the expansion of our digital footprint, which are funded through CAPEX. These new modules are tangible deliverables that align with the annual roadmap and receive significant visibility from the Steering Committee. While performance is important, the funding and approval processes are heavily geared towards launching these new "investment" projects. Iterating on existing features, though valuable, doesn't always have the same dedicated budget or a clear path for approval as a major new CAPEX project.

# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Problem Statement
Kcell's Product Managers are structurally prevented from saving failing live products because internal financial governance rigidly locks resources to pre-planned "Capital Projects" (New Features), while classifying critical iteration and optimization as unfunded "Maintenance" (OPEX). This forces teams to continue building new features even when existing ones are hemorrhaging customers.

## 2. Job To Be Done (JTBD)
**When** I discover that a live critical feature is failing (high churn) while my team is fully booked on a new strategic CAPEX initiative, **I want to** instantly justify and execute a resource pivot using financial language **so that** I can save the customer base and asset value without triggering a 3-month "Change Request" bureaucracy or losing my funding.

## 3. Target User
**Arman, Senior Product Manager (SuperApp)**
*   **Role:** Responsible for delivering the "Digital Ecosystem" roadmap.
*   **Context:** Operates under strict "Project Governance"; his performance is judged by "On-Time Delivery" of new assets.
*   **Constraints:** Terrified of the "Change Request" process because it implies failure to plan; lacks the financial vocabulary to argue why "fixing a bug" is an "investment."

## 4. Current Pain Points
*   **The "Zombie Feature" Effect:** Managers are forced to let live features die (e.g., Step Counter losing 50% users/week) to birth new ones (Travel Insurance) because the budget dictates it.
*   **Administrative Paralysis:** "Change Requests" are viewed as extensive, punitive processes, effectively enforcing a Waterfall methodology where the plan is more important than reality.
*   **Misaligned Incentives:** Success is defined by the *Steering Committee* (Delivery of Assets) rather than the *Customer* (Retention/Value).
*   **Rigidity of "Business Case":** Budgets are locked to scopes defined 12 months prior, making them obsolete by the time development starts.

## 5. Proposed AI Agent — Purpose
**The "CAPEX-to-Value Bridge" Agent**
This AI agent exists to act as a real-time governance intermediary between Product Implementation and Financial Control. Its purpose is to automate the friction of re-allocation. It continuously monitors live product metrics against the committed project plan. When it detects that a live asset (product) is depreciating (churning) faster than a new asset can be created, it automatically generates a compliant, data-backed "Investment Pivot Request." This agent translates "product logic" (users are leaving) into "finance logic" (protecting asset value), empowering PMs to switch tracks legally and quickly.

## 6. Functional Requirements

### Inputs
*   **Strategic Roadmap:** Ingests the committed project plan, deadlines, and CAPEX codes for current initiatives (e.g., "Travel Insurance - Q3").
*   **Live Performance Data:** Connects to product analytics (mixpanel/database) to monitor "Asset Health" (Churn Rate, DAU, Onboarding Success) of live features.
*   **Financial Rulebook:** Ingests Kcell's internal capitalization policies (IAS 38 interpretation) and resource cost rates.

### Outputs
*   **"Asset Risk Alert":** A notification to the PM and Steering Committee when a live feature's performance drops below a critical threshold (e.g., >10% weekly churn).
*   **"Opportunity Cost Calculator":** A real-time dashboard showing the financial loss of *ignoring* the live bug vs. the value of *delaying* the new feature.
*   **A "Pivot Business Case" (Artifact):** An auto-generated, pre-formatted PDF memo. It populates the standard "Change Request" form with data proving that fixing the bug leads to higher Net Present Value (NPV) than sticking to the plan.

### Decisions & Recommendations
*   **Recommendation Engine:** "Recommend pausing [Project A] for [2 Sprints] to resolve [Critical Failure B]. Projected ROI impact: +15%."

### Integration
*   Integrates with **Jira** (to tag scope items) and the internal **ERP/Project Management System** (to flag the budget lines).

## 7. Non-Goals
*   The agent **does not** automatically re-assign developers or change their tasks (humans must decide).
*   The agent **does not** rewrite the company's accounting standards or violate IAS 38.
*   The agent **does not** write code to fix the actual product bugs.

## 8. Success Metrics (Outcome-Based)
*   **Pivot Velocity:** Time from identifying a critical market signal (churn) to official budget re-approval (Goal: < 48 hours, down from current status of weeks/months).
*   **Asset Health Maintenance:** percentage (%) of engineering budget successfully reallocated to optimization/iteration mid-year.
*   **Retention Impact:** Improvement in customer retention for "saved" features post-intervention.
*   **Reduction in "Failed Assets":** Decrease in the number of features that are launched and immediately abandoned.

# Executive Summary: Financial & Governance Feasibility Analysis

**To:** Executive Investment Committee, Kcell
**Date:** 26.01.2026
**Subject:** Go/No-Go Decision on "CAPEX-to-Value Bridge" AI Agent

This document evaluates the financial viability and regulatory compliance of deploying the proposed AI Agent designed to automate the strategic reallocation of resources (Product Pivot Requests).

---

## Section 1: Financial Reasoning (ROI Calculation)

### Step 1: Salary Assumptions (Kazakhstan Corporate Context)

To estimate the value of labor saved, we apply a conservative benchmark for a Mid-Senior Product Manager or Corporate Strategy Manager in the telecommunications sector in Kazakhstan.

*   **Gross Monthly Salary:** 1,200,000 KZT
    *   *assumption based on senior specialist/mid-management roles in Almaty/Astana.*
*   **Standard Working Hours:** 160 hours/month
*   **Fully Loaded Hourly Cost:** ~8,500 KZT
    *   *Base hourly rate (7,500 KZT) plus ~13% overhead for taxes/benefits/workspace.*

### Step 2: Time Savings Valuation

The AI agent automates data gathering, "Change Request" drafting, and financial justification, saving an estimated **10 hours per week** per Product Manager.

| Metric | Calculation | Value (KZT) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Weekly Savings (Per Person)** | 10 hours * 8,500 KZT | **85,000 KZT** |
| **Monthly Savings (Per Person)** | 85,000 * 4 weeks | **340,000 KZT** |
| **Annual Savings (Per Person)** | 85,000 * 48 weeks | **4,080,000 KZT** |

**Scalability:**
*   **Single Pilot User:** 4.08 Million KZT / Year
*   **Digital Product Team (5 Managers):** 20.4 Million KZT / Year

### Step 3: Cost of AI Agent (Estimation)

Costs include internal development, enterprise API usage (to Ensure data privacy), and ongoing maintenance.

*   **Year 1 Development (One-off):** 6,000,000 KZT
    *   *Estimate: 2 months of Senior Developer time + Project Management.*
*   **Annual Infrastructure & API Costs:** 1,500,000 KZT
    *   *Enterprise-grade LLM tokens and secure hosting.*
*   **Annual Maintenance:** 1,200,000 KZT
    *   *10% of dev cost for updates/patches.*

**Total Year 1 Cost Benchmark:** ~8,700,000 KZT

### Step 4: ROI Summary (5-User Deployment)

*   **Total Year 1 Savings:** 20,400,000 KZT
*   **Total Year 1 Costs:** 8,700,000 KZT
*   **Net Year 1 Benefit:** **+11,700,000 KZT**

**Payback Period:** Approximately **5-6 Months**.

**Logic:** The project pays for itself in under two quarters comfortably. The primary value driver is not just the labor savings, but the *avoided opportunity cost* of continuing to fund failing features, which is likely 10x higher than the labor savings calculated here.

---

## Section 2: Governance & Legal Compliance (Kazakhstan AI Ethics Test)

### 1. Data Residency & Sovereignty
The agent processes internal strategic documents (Roadmaps, Budgets) and potentially user performance metrics.
*   **Risk:** Sending strategic trade secrets or user data to public US-based cloud endpoints violates internal security policies and potentially the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan "On Personal Data and their Protection" if PII is mixed in.
*   **Requirement:** The solution must be deployed within a secure perimeter (Virtual Private Cloud) or utilize an Enterprise Agreement with the LLM provider that guarantees zero data retention for training.
*   **Risk Level:** **Medium**

### 2. Transparency & Explainability
The agent generates a "Pivot Business Case" (PDF Memo) which justifies the recommendation.
*   **Evaluation:** The output is text-based and cites specific financial inputs (Churn Rate vs. CAPEX Code). The logic is fully auditable by a human controller. It is a "White Box" determination, not a "Black Box" prediction.
*   **Risk Level:** **Low**

### 3. Human Accountability
The agent acts as a drafter and advisor. It does not have the authority to sign the Change Request or move funds.
*   **Evaluation:** Legal liability remains strictly with the Product Manager who reviews and submits the generated generated memo, and the Steering Committee that approves it. The AI is a tool, not an agent of authority.
*   **Risk Level:** **Low**

---

## Section 3: Final Go / No-Go Recommendation

### Verdict: **GO WITH CONDITIONS**

**Justification:**
*   The financial case is compelling with a payback period of <6 months on labor savings alone.
*   The strategic value (stopping "Zombie Projects") vastly outweighs the implementation cost.
*   The technical complexity is low (RAG architecture on structured internal data).

**Conditions for Approval:**
1.  **Enterprise Data Contract:** Must use an LLM provider with a "No Training on Customer Data" guarantee to protect corporate strategy.
2.  **PII Sanitization:** The agent must only ingest aggregated metrics (e.g., "15% Churn"), not raw user lists, to bypass severe data residency friction.
3.  **Human Tollgate:** The generated "Pivot Request" must require a digital signature from the human Manager before submission to Finance.
