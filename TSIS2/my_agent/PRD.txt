Product Requirements Document (PRD): AI Manager

1. Overview
This document specifies the requirements for a Python implementation of an AI Manager class. The goal is to create a robust, error-tolerant class that can read text files and generate mock strategic estimations.

2. Class Definition
Class Name: `AIManager`

3. Attributes
The class must be initialized with the following attributes:
- `name` (str): The name of the AI manager. Must be a non-empty string.
- `description` (str): A brief description of the manager's role. Must be a non-empty string.

4. Methods

Method Name: `estimate(file_path: str) -> dict`

Requirements:
4.1. Input Validation:
- The method must accept a single argument `file_path` which must be a string.
- If `file_path` is not a string, the method must raise a `TypeError` with the message "File path must be a string."

4.2. File Handling:
- The method must verify that the file exists at the given path.
- If the file does not exist, the method must raise a `FileNotFoundError` with a clear message including the filename.
- The method must strictly open the file in read-only mode ('r') with 'utf-8' encoding.

4.3. Content Processing:
- The method reads the content of the file.
- If the file is empty, the method must return a default result indicating "No content to analyze".

4.4. Estimation Logic (Mock):
- The method performs a mock analysis on the text.
- It calculates a `strategy_score` based on the word count of the file (e.g., min(100, word_count)).
- It generates a `summary` string based on the first 10 words of the text.

4.5. Return Value:
- The method MUST return a dictionary (dict) with the following structure:
  {
    "strategy_score": <int>,
    "summary": <str>,
    "status": "success"
  }

5. Code Style & Documentation
- The code must be PEP 8 compliant.
- The class and method must have docstrings explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.
- Type hinting is mandatory for all method signatures.

6. Security
- The code must not execute any content from the file (no `eval()` or `exec()`).
